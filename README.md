When creating a new issue, you will be prompted to choose an issue template to start with. Please pick the appropriate template depending on if you have a bug report, feature request, or question, and try to retain the original format to ensure consistency and readability.


### Bug Reports
When reporting bugs, please provide a summary of what is happening, reproduction steps to aide others/devs in recreating the issue on their end, and the expected behavior.

### Feature Requests
Feature requests can range from new modding capabilities, ingame content (maps, tools, vehicles, etc), or anything that else that you'd like to see that you think would improve the game.

### Questions
If you have a question about how things work in the game, or anything else related, feel free to ask.
